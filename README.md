# Scraping Financial Data from Stockbit.com


Stockbit.com is a well-known security whose operation is in Indonesia. It provides so many useful information for investors in the stock market, for example the financial data. This data has been extracted from the original financial statement released by the company and already put into a table. For investor who wants to analyze a company financial condition, surely this data is very useful and will save so much time instead of taking the numbers from the original financial statement.

In this notebook, I use selenium to scrape the data that stored in the table using Selenium package. Hopefully this will help so many investor, especially who based in Indonesia, when they analyze performance of company.

I believe all my works are not perfect yet, that's why I welcome any suggestion that could improve my works. Thank you!
